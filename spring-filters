Spring Filters

	Delegating Filter Proxy

	Spring provides a Filter implementation named DelegatingFilterProxy that allows bridging between the Servlet container’s lifecycle and Spring’s ApplicationContext. The Servlet container allows registering Filters using its own standards, but it is not aware of Spring defined Beans. DelegatingFilterProxy can be registered via standard Servlet container mechanisms, but delegate all the work to a Spring Bean that implements Filter

	Another benefit of DelegatingFilterProxy is that it allows delaying looking Filter bean instances. This is important because the container needs to register the Filter instances before the container can startup. However, Spring typically uses a ContextLoaderListener to load the Spring Beans which will not be done until after the Filter instances need to be registered.
