Class
1.Outer classs can be declared public or package-private(default)

default means it is visible only inside a package

There are 2 types of nested classed,
	1.Static Nested class
	2.Inner classes(Non static nested classes)
		Inner classes are of 2 more types whcih are defined inside the method body
				1.Local classes
				2.Annonymous Class


	Need for Nested Class

	1.If a class is used only in one place den we can create a inner class,
	2.It increases encapsulation-If we want to create a private vaiable and also to provide access to other class 


NESTED classes 2 types

1.STATIC NESTED CLASS

	a static nested class is behaviorally a top-level class that has been nested in another top-level class for packaging convenience.

	Static Nested class is a regular class it can be acessed outisde the outer class also

	Static Nested class do not have access to members of the outer class.

2.NON STATIC CLASS OR INNER CLASS		

	Inner class cannot have static declarations because inner class is always associated with the instance.

	can have static members provided that they are constant variables

	Inner class have access to all the fields of enclosing class even if they are declared private,

	Inner class cannot have any static members(declare of define)

	Nested class can be declared private,protected,Default(package private),public

**An instance of InnerClass can exist only within an instance of OuterClass and has direct access to the methods and fields of its
		enclosing instance.

	If a class is defined inside a class then 
	Vehicle v =new Vehicle();
		 Vehicle.Bike b = v.new Bike();

		to access the inner class members

			There are two special kinds of inner classes: local classes and anonymous classes.

			1. Local classes are the classes that are defined inside the block, typically inside the body of the method or a for loop or if condition

				A local class has access to the members of its enclosing class,
				The local class can only access local variables which are declard final or effectively final

				Starting in Java SE 8, if you declare the local class in a method, it can access the method's parameters

				For global variables there is no such restriction .

				(effective final- a varibale whose value did not change afte the initialization)

						*A local class can have static members provided that they are constant variables. (A constant variable is a variable of primitive type or 	type String that is declared final and initialized with a compile-time constant expression

		*You cannot have interface inside the block as they are inherently static

						Shadowing 

						1.To refer to the member variable of the inner class FirstLevel, use the keyword this to represent the enclosing scope:
								System.out.println("this.x = " + this.x);
						2.Refer to member variables that enclose larger scopes by the class name to which they belong
								System.out.println("ShadowTest.this.x = " + ShadowTest.this.x);


						Serialization of inner classes, including local and anonymous classes, is strongly discouraged.

						When the Java compiler compiles certain constructs, such as inner classes, it creates synthetic constructs; these are classes, methods, fields, and other constructs that do not have a corresponding construct in the source code. 
						 synthetic constructs can vary among different Java compiler implementations, which means that .class files can vary among different implementations as well. Consequently, you may have compatibility issues if you serialize an inner class and then deserialize it with a different JRE implementation.
						

						
			2.Anonymous class- it is an expression
					Class which are declared and instantiated in the same time which do not have name
					Create a anonymous class if you want to use a class only once

					Anonymous class can access only those local variables which are decaled final or effective final.

					You cannot declare static initializers or member interfaces in an anonymous class.

					An anonymous class can have static members provided that they are constant variables.

**Inner classes may inherit static members that are not compile-time constants even though they may not declare them. Nested classes that are not inner classes may declare static members freely, in accordance with the usual rules of the Java programming language.

LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS

	Functional Interface cannot have a inner class as well
	

	Unlike local classes and annonymous classes , Lambda expressions can only access members of enclosing scope which are final or effective final
	
	Like local and anonymous classes, lambda expressions can capture variables; they have the same access to local variables of the enclosing scope. However, unlike local and anonymous classes, lambda expressions do not have any shadowing issues 

	Lambda expressions are lexically scoped. This means that they do not inherit any names from a supertype or introduce a new level of scoping

	 the JDK defines several standard functional interfaces, which you can find in the package java.util.function

 	you do not have to enclose a void method invocation in braces

	 If there is single expression then we do not need to use flower brackets {}, also 	Java runtime evaluates the expression and return the value.

	 A return statement is not an expression; in a lambda expression, you must enclose statements in braces ({}). However, you do not have to enclose a void method invocation in braces. 

	

	 PREDICATE<T>: has a method test(T t) which returns a boolean value

	 CONSUMER<T>: has a method accept(T t) which has void return type

	  FUNCTION<T,R>: interface contains the method R apply(T t)

	 SUPPLIER:		The functional interface Supplier contains one method get that takes no arguments and returns an object(use can use it 					to return a new object)
	 				eg:	() -> { return new HashSet<>(); }

	 BiFunction<T, T, T> merger is a function interface which accepts 2 arguments and produce result, has method apply
	


	when to use

	Nested class: Use it if your requirements are similar to those of a local class, you want to make the type more widely available, and you don't require access to local variables or method parameters.

	Use a non-static nested class (or inner class) if you require access to an enclosing instance's non-public fields and methods. Use a static nested class if you don't require this access.

			Local Classes-
					If you need to create more than once instance of a class 
					Invoke additional methods later or access its constructor(Similar to normal class).
					

			Anonymous class
					If you need to add additional fields or methods , (you cannot have parametrized constructors here)

			Lambda Expressions
					If you need to implement a functional interface,or
					 do not want to access the constructor
					  or you dont want to add additional fields etc


METHOD REFERENCE
	If you are using lambda expressions to call a method then use method reference

	Are easy to read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name. 

	Reference to a static method	ContainingClass::staticMethodName

	Reference to an instance method of a particular object	containingObject::instanceMethodName

	Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type	ContainingType::methodName
		eg:Arrays.sort(stringArray, String::compareToIgnoreCase);

	Reference to a constructor	ClassName::new


	eg for constructor reference

		You can use a constructor reference in place of the lambda expression as follows:

		Set<Person> rosterSet = transferElements(roster, HashSet::new);
			The Java compiler infers that you want to create a HashSet collection that contains elements of type Person. Alternatively, you can specify this as follows:

Streams

	Pipeline is a sequence of aggregate operations

	Stream is not a data structure that holds the data, its a carries values from a source through a pipeline

	Stream has a source

	Stream has zero or more intermediate operations which return a stream of its predicate type eg filter,mapInt etc method of stream

	Stream has Terminal operation which does not return a stream eg forEach,avegare method of stream


			 list.stream().
                mapToInt(s->Integer.parseInt(s)).
                filter(e-> e%2==0).
                forEach((m)->System.out.println(m));

 Reduction Operations:The JDK contains many terminal operations such as average that return one value by combining the contents of a stream.

 	eg:average,getAsDouble() etc


 For general purpose reduction use stream.reduce method

 reduce is used for immutable reduction  and collect is used as mutable reduction

 	Keep in mind that streams implementation for reduce are same for reduce and collect so we are providing intial value
 	For parallel streams they perform fork joint source will be split into individual sub tasks(roughly 4* numbe rof cores).

			 		eg
			 			Integer totalAgeReduce = roster
			   .stream()
			   .map(Person::getAge)
			   .reduce(
			       0,
			       (a, b) -> a + b);


						       	The reduce operation in this example takes two arguments:

						identity: The identity element is both the initial value of the reduction and the default result if there are no elements in the stream. In this example, the identity element is 0; this is the initial value of the sum of ages and the default value if no members exist in the collection roster.

						accumulator: The accumulator function takes two parameters: a partial result of the reduction (in this example, the sum of all processed integers so far) and the next element of the stream (in this example, an integer). It returns a new partial result. In this example, the accumulator function is a lambda expression that adds two Integer values and returns an Integer value:

						(a, b) -> a + b


						The reduce operation always returns a new value. However, the accumulator function also returns a new value every time it processes an element of a stream


			There is one more reduce operation with 3 arguments- It has a intial value,accumulator function and Combiner funtion
				The combiner function is usually used for parallel streams, for combining the results of each streams running in parallel
				Even if we are using sequential stream we cannot pass null as third argument.we will get null pointer exception

Java complier internally wih replace string contacination(s1+s2+s3+s4) wih StringBuilder if there are more than 2 concatination
		
collect is reduction operation for mutuable objects,eg if we use reduce on the string which is immutable , a new string gets created which will effect the performace so we are usig collect.
		Collector is a interface and Collectors is a implementation for Collector which has methods like Collectors.toList etc.

		

 Differences Between Aggregate Operations and Iterators


 Aggregate operations use internal Iteration,they do not contain a method like next to instruct them to process the next element of the collection. With internal delegation, your application determines what collection it iterates, but the JDK determines how to iterate the collection. 
With external iteration, your application determines both what collection it iterates and how it iterates it. 

However, external iteration can only iterate over the elements of a collection sequentially. 
Internal iteration does not have this limitation. It can more easily take advantage of parallel computing.

They process elements from a stream: Aggregate operations process elements from a stream, not directly from a collection. Consequently, they are also called stream operations.

They support behavior as parameters: You can specify lambda expressions as parameters for most aggregate operations. This enables you to customize the behavior of a particular aggregate operation.


Streams vs normal iterators

			Collection.forEach() uses the collection iterator and the processing order is defined

			Collection.stream().forEach() ignores the iretaror and take the element one by one hence the processing order is not defined.

For-each loop

		This is a methods of Iterable interface. All the Collection interfaces extends Iterable Interface

		The for-each construct is also applicable to arrays, where it hides the index variable rather than the iterator. The following method returns the sum of the values in an int array:

		The for-each loop hides the iterator, so you cannot call remove. Therefore, the for-each loop is not usable for filtering. Similarly it is not usable for loops where you need to replace elements in a list or array as you traverse it. Finally, it is not usable for loops that must iterate over multiple collections in parallel. These shortcomings were known by the designers, who made a conscious decision to go with a clean, simple construct that would cover the great majority of cases.

Iterable Interface

		public interface Iterable<T>
		Implementing this interface allows an object to be the target of the "for-each loop" statement.

Interface

		Interface allows static methods,default methods,constants and method signatures.
		Interface can be either public or default(package private)

		All the components in the interface are public( we dont have to explicitly declare it)

		All the constants are by default public static final( we dont have to explicitly declare it)

		Default methods enable you to add new functionality to existing interfaces and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.


Using Core Java we can develop only stand alone applications.
2 types of stand alone applications
	1.GUI-Graphica User Interface- eg desktop applications or calculator
	2.CUI-Character User Inerface - Applicatios which are run using the command prompt also knows as console based applications
