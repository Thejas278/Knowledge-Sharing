difference between docker and virtual machine




	operating system

		Application layer
		Kernel
------------------------------
	Hardware

Operating system has 2 things
		1.Application Layer-All aplications will recide in the application layer
		2.Kernel-Kernel will interact with the hardware of the laptop


Virtual Machine vs Docker
Vm will have its own Application layer and Kernel
Docker will use the Application Layer and kernel of the host 

Vm will have huge size,Docker will be smaller in size 
Vm will take some minutes to run,Docker will run in milli seconds.
Vm can be installled in any host
Docker is mainly written for Linux Operating system hence we cannot in windows os because Windows os has Windows kernel and docker needs Lynux kernel

For windows 

Docker Desktop can be used which allows us to run Lynux based containers on mac and windows as well.It uses Hypervisor layer  with a light weight Linux distribution to privode the Lynux needed Kernel

Docker Image
	Is a executable artfact similar to a jar file but docker image will have everything to run the application like for java or node applicatio it will have java run time or the node,npm as well.

Docker Container - A running instance of a image is a container, from one image we can run multiple containers


In cmd run
		docker images -to see all the images.
		docker ps - to see all the containers

Docker hub will have all the official Images.
	
	docker pull postgres will pull the latest postgres image

	docker run postgres - will run the image 

	to run the docker image in the background use docker run -d postgres

** We can use docker run directly without using the pull command and docker will automatically download the image for you and run

** To make applications running in a container, we have to bind it to a port ,
	 we can use docker run -d -p 3044(outside where u want port):80(port of container) postgres.
	Now the postgres will be acessible in 3044 port

We can even start the previously stopped container.

To build the docker images
	docker build -t node-app:1.0 filelocation
